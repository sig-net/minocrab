# Onboarding

The day-one path, a map of the `notes/`, and the first hour's jargon.
Everything here exists elsewhere in more depth; this is the order to read
it in.

## Day one, in order

1. [README.md](README.md) — what MinoCrab is, side-by-side with Compact,
   the feature tour, the stability tiers.
2. [VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md) — where the confidence comes from:
   which artifact is warranted by what (PI-equality, spec harness,
   byte-gates), suite by suite.
3. [notes/ledger-abi.org](notes/ledger-abi.org) §6 — the equivalence
   criterion everything hangs off: same typed I/O plus identical
   `pis`/`pi_skips` on a shared `ProofPreimage`, instruction streams free
   to differ.
4. [notes/architecture.org](notes/architecture.org) — the layer map
   (ZKIR bindings → IR builder → eDSL → stdlib → simulator).
5. [notes/review-queue.org](notes/review-queue.org) — what has had human
   eyes, and what is still agent-only.
6. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — before your first change.

## Glossary, for the first hour

- **PI-equality** — two artifacts accept the same `ProofPreimage` with
  identical public-input streams (`pis`/`pi_skips`). The strongest
  warrant in the repo: "same statement". Instruction streams may differ.
- **FAB** — field-aligned binary, Midnight's encoding of typed values as
  field-element *limbs*. A `Bytes<32>` is two limbs `[hi, lo]` (1 + 31
  bytes); a `bytes n` atom is `ceil(n/31)` limbs, leftover first.
- **The four vault artifacts** — `erc20_vault` (the compat **port**,
  PI-equal to compactc: the differential warrant), `_opt` (M10
  optimized: own statement, spec-harness warrant), `_borsh` (opt on the
  M11 wire format), `_modern` (the showcase twin, byte-identical to
  borsh). Four forks in lockstep is a *feature*: each link in
  `compactc ≡ port ≡ opt ≡ borsh ≡ modern` is a separately-asserted
  warrant, and the divergence ledgers make leaving a link's coverage an
  explicit, reviewed edit.
- **Zero movement** — the serialized ZKIR of every circuit is
  byte-identical across a change. The default expectation for API work;
  proven by dump comparison, not claimed.
- **The fold** — `fold_immediate_copies`: a `Copy` of an immediate is a
  rename, folded before instruction-for-instruction comparison so both
  sides are normalised the same way.
- **k / rows** — Halo2 cost: `rows` is occupied rows, `k` is the padded
  table's log2 size. **Prove time and RAM track 2^k, not rows** — a row
  cut only pays when it crosses a power-of-two boundary.
- **Impact** — Midnight's on-chain VM; circuits emit its op stream as
  guarded public inputs, which the ledger re-executes and checks.
- **Guarded / `_under`** — an op under a branch condition: the guard is
  an operand of the Impact instruction, and a false guard absorbs zeros.
- **The taint lint** — the static instrument for hash-preimage limbs
  that no honest-input test can check. Its baseline is frozen; new
  findings fail CI.
- **M-numbers** (M0..M25) — milestones, in `milestones.org`; closed ones
  are summarized there with pointers into `notes/`. A citation like
  "M10 rung i" means that milestone's recorded decision.
- **`.bytes()`** — the one way OUT of a value-meaning newtype; grep for
  it to find every place a distinction is deliberately dropped.
