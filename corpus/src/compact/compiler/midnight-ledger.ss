;; clause:
;;   (function class function-name ([input-name input-type] ...) result-type
;;     description
;;     (vm-op ...))
;;   (when scheme-expression clause ...)
;; op:
;;   (op-name [op-arg-name op-arg-value] ...)
;;
;; class is one of:
;;   read       information is extracted from the ledger
;;   write      information is written to the ledger
;;   update     information is updated in the ledger
;;   remove     information is removed from the ledger
;;   js-only    callable only from javascript
;;
;; when class is js-only, result-type and vm-op are treated as interpolated
;; javascript string instead.
;;
;; init is interpreted as if it were an argument to an operation
;;
;; where e.g. (addi [immediate 5]) gets encoded at runtime to
;;   { addi: { immediate: 5 } }
;; single ops, e.g. '(pop)' get encoded to a string:
;;   "pop"
;; ops will use the following symbolic placeholders:
;; values may use ADT-arg-name, type-arg-name
;;
;; inside operation arguments, the following scheme primitives are used, and
;; should be evaluated at compile-time.  the one exception to this is that the
;; arguments to + might not be constant, in which case the addition should be
;; performed at run time.
;; - list, reverse, car, cdr, length
;; - +, *, expt, add1, sub1
;; - void (standing in for null values)
;;
;; The following variables should be instantiated at compile time to the context
;; where the form is being used:
;; - f, the path to the field being operated on, and
;; - f-cached, a boolean indicating if f is guaranteed to be in cache.
;;
;; A path is a list of either aligned value instances, or the symbol 'stack.
;; Aligned value literals are created with the (align value bytes) literal, which
;; should emit code generating this literal AlignedValue (of a single atom) at runtime.
;;
;; Similarly, the following correspond to state initializers at runtime:
;; - (state-value 'null) initializes a null value
;; - (state-value 'cell aligned-value) initializes a state cell with the given value
;; - (state-value 'map ([key value] ...)) initializes a map with given key-value pairs
;; - (state-value 'merkle-tree ([key value] ...)) initializes a bounded merkle tree with
;;   given key-value pairs (Uint64 indexes as keys, and Bytes32 hash values)
;; - (state-value 'array (val ...)) initializes an array with given values
;;
;; Finally, the following runtime functions should emit code to the corresponding runtime effect
;; - (rt-aligned-concat value ...) concatenate the value ... AlignedValues into one.
;; - (rt-null type) output the default instance of the type
;; - (rt-max-sizeof type) output the maximum serialized size of a value of the given type
;; - (rt-value->int aligned-value) outputs an integer represented by an aligned-value
;; - (rt-coin-commit coin) outputs a coin commitment
;; - (rt-leaf-hash value) outputs the leaf to be placed in a merkle tree for value
;;
;; type-arg-name must be one of ADT-arg-name or a defined ledger type.
