//! THE SIGNET ROUND TRIP'S SHARED MACHINERY — the block's configuration,
//! the record a request files, and the attested output a settle verifies.
//!
//! Every Sig Network operation a Midnight contract makes is one future split
//! across two transactions. A REQUEST circuit files a signing record and
//! cross-calls the Signet singleton so the MPC comes to read it; a SETTLE
//! circuit, in a later transaction, verifies the MPC's attestation over the
//! typed response and consumes the record. The ledger map entry IS the
//! suspended continuation; the attestation is the value the future resolves
//! with. (notes/signet-async.org is the design of record — M35.)
//!
//! # What lives here, and why
//!
//! M35 put a `Pending<Env, Resp>` slot here, keyed by a hand-written
//! `Response` type per kind. M37 rung D replaced it with
//! [`crate::evm_flow::Pending<Call, Env, WORDS>`], which is keyed by the CALL
//! ([`crate::evm::EvmCall`]) and derives the kind byte, the response type,
//! the ABI words, the selector, the gas envelope and the signing path from
//! it. What is left in this module is what the typed slot is BUILT ON, and
//! it is here rather than there because it is the WIRE — the MPC's side of
//! the protocol, which no contract-facing API gets to reshape:
//!
//! - [`Signet`] — the block's one configuration slot (signer address, MPC
//!   response key, request nonce, caip2 id, EVM chain id). Five ledger
//!   fields a contract declares once; `#[derive(Ledger)]` threads its offset
//!   into every `Pending` and `Fired` slot, which is why a typed request
//!   takes no `&SELF.signet`.
//! - `file_request` — the filing every request does, whatever the slot:
//!   read the context, assemble the record, hash its id, assert freshness,
//!   bump the nonce, store it, store the environment beside it, notify the
//!   singleton with the record map's own path. `evm_flow`'s three request
//!   methods are this function plus a transaction.
//! - [`EvmTx`] and [`SignRequest`] — the transaction shape the record holds
//!   and the request that files it. `evm::build_tx` builds the first from a
//!   call type; nothing outside this crate writes either by hand.
//! - [`Attested`] — `serializedOutput` on the wire: the kind byte then the
//!   attested value. The signed preimage is over exactly its limbs.
//! - [`Outcome`] — what a settle hands back.
//! - The three disclosure labels and the [`Requested`] / [`Settled`] label
//!   sets a request and a settle publish.
//!
//! RETIRED IN M37 RUNG D, with the vault that used them: `Pending`, `Fired`,
//! the `Settle` ticket, the `Response` and `FailureResponse` traits, and
//! `Commit<T>` (whose domain was a `&str` at both ends —
//! [`crate::evm_flow::Commit<T, Tag>`] takes it as a type, so a `to` and an
//! `open` that disagree no longer compiles).
//!
//! TYPES CONSTRAIN THE AUTHOR, ASSERTS CONSTRAIN THE PROVER: nothing in
//! either module removes an in-circuit check on untrusted input.
//!
//! NO TIMEOUT, by decision (dmd, 2026-09-05): a request with no response
//! stays pending; a refund happens only on an ATTESTED non-success
//! ([`crate::evm_flow::Pending::refund`]).
//!
//! # What does not compile
//!
//! An environment with a private field (`#[derive(LedgerRepr)]` has no impl
//! at `Private`, so a secret cannot be captured across the suspension by
//! accident — what Rust's own `async` would silently do):
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use minocrab::{Private, Public};
//! use minocrab_std::v3::{LedgerRepr, Uint, B32};
//!
//! #[derive(LedgerRepr)]
//! struct Env { amount: Uint<64, Public>, secret: B32<Private> }
//! ```
//!
//! THE SAME CODE WITH THE ONE CHANGE REVERTED compiles:
//!
//! ```
//! use minocrab::Public;
//! use minocrab_std::v3::{LedgerRepr, Uint, B32};
//!
//! #[derive(LedgerRepr)]
//! struct Env { amount: Uint<64, Public>, secret: B32<Public> }
