//! THE README'S CROSS-CHAIN EXAMPLE, COMPILED — notes/evm-calls.org §0's
//! target shape, as a real contract with real circuits (M37 rung C).
//!
//! A treasury that sends ERC-20 tokens on an EVM chain through Sig Network's
//! MPC. Three circuits, and every line of them is business:
//!
//! - `send(token, to, amount)` files `transfer(to, amount)` against `token`,
//!   remembering the amount and the CALLER;
//! - `complete(ticket)` settles a successful transfer — anyone may call it,
//!   because the MPC's attestation is the gate;
//! - `refund(ticket)` settles a non-success — only the original caller may
//!   call it, because the environment's owner commitment is opened with a
//!   fresh witness.
//!
//! WHAT IS NOT WRITTEN HERE, and where it went (the point of the milestone):
//!
//! | not written                       | comes from                     |
//! |-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
//! | `a9059cbb`                        | `Erc20Transfer::selector()`    |
//! | the two ABI words, the word count | `AbiTuple` (checked, E0080)    |
//! | the response type and its schema  | `Attested<Bool>` at the kind   |
//! | the gas envelope and limit        | `build_tx` + `Erc20Transfer`   |
//! | the signing path                  | `SigningPath::contract_path`   |
//! | the notification depth and path   | the slot's own ledger path     |
//! | the record format version         | `Pending::complete` / `refund` |
//! | `&TREASURY.signet`                | `#[derive(Ledger)]`            |
//! | the owner commitment and its gate | `Owned` + `request_owned`      |
//! | "a `false` must not complete"     | `Erc20Transfer::Outcome`       |
//!
//! WHAT IS STILL WRITTEN, on purpose (notes/evm-calls.org §5): the labels,
//! the `Discloses` tuple, and the two values §7 has yet to find a home for —
//! the EVM nonce and the MPC key version.
//!
//! CALLEE ALLOW-LIST: this example takes the token as an argument, which a
//! deployment must not do unqualified — a non-conforming ERC-20 that returns
//! nothing produces an attested FAILURE for a transfer that moved the tokens
//! (crate::evm_flow's hazard note, notes/evm-calls.org §3.1). A real treasury
//! pins its tokens in a ledger cell and builds the callee with
//! `Contract::from_address`.
