//! ERC-721 — the NFT interface, and its three STATIC calls (M38 rung C,
//! notes/evm-interfaces.org §2.4).
//!
//! [`Erc721`] is a marker of its own — NOT `Extends<Erc20>` and not
//! extended by one. The two standards are siblings that happen to share a
//! vocabulary: an ERC-721 has a `balanceOf`, an `approve` and a
//! `transferFrom` too, and they mean something else.
//!
//! # The shared selectors, and why they are not a problem HERE
//!
//! Two of the three calls below hash to ERC-20's selectors, byte for byte:
//!
//! | this module | ERC-20's | selector |
//! |-------------|----------|----------|
//! | [`TransferFrom`] `(from, to, tokenId)` | [`erc20::TransferFrom`] `(from, to, amount)` | `23b872dd` |
//! | [`Approve`] `(to, tokenId)` | [`erc20::Approve`] `(spender, amount)` | `095ea7b3` |
//!
//! Both pairs spell `(address,address,uint256)` and `(address,uint256)`, so
//! the calldata a caller files is IDENTICAL and no amount of care about the
//! signature could separate them. What separates them is the RETURN, and
//! that is not on the wire the caller sends:
//!
//! - an ERC-20 `transferFrom` returns a `bool` and our type says so, so the
//!   MPC decodes a flag and [`succeeded`](super::EvmCall::succeeded) is
//!   `is_true`;
//! - an ERC-721 `transferFrom` returns NOTHING and reverts on failure, so
//!   our type is `Return = Unit` and `succeeded` is [`always`].
//!
//! Get that backwards in either direction and you get exactly the two
//! hazards notes/evm-calls.org §3.1 is about. Declaring an NFT transfer as
//! the ERC-20 one asks the MPC to decode a `bool` out of empty return data:
//! the decode fails terminally, the request resolves as the FAILURE kind,
//! and a settle circuit refunds a transfer that moved the token. Declaring
//! an ERC-20 transfer as the NFT one throws the flag away: a token that
//! returned `false` completes as a success.
//!
//! THE CALLEE'S INTERFACE IS THE TYPE THAT DISTINGUISHES THEM. A
//! `Contract<Erc721>` is an address a contract has CLAIMED is an NFT, and
//! the `Extends` bound on `request` will not let an `erc20::TransferFrom`
//! near it — not because the bytes differ but because the claim does. Both
//! directions are compile errors:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use minocrab::v3::Circuit3;
//! use minocrab::{Private, Public};
//! use minocrab_contracts::evm::{erc20, erc721, Kinded};
//! use minocrab_contracts::evm_flow::{Contract, Pending};
//! use minocrab_contracts::signet_flow::Signet;
//! use minocrab_std::v3::{Bytes, Ledger, LedgerRepr, Uint};
//!
//! #[derive(LedgerRepr)] struct Amount { amount: Uint<64, Public> }
//!
//! #[derive(Ledger)]
//! struct Block {
//!     signet: Signet,
//!     pulls: Pending<Kinded<erc20::TransferFrom, 1>, Amount, 3>,
//! }
//! const BLOCK: Block = Block::new();
//!
//! fn pull(
//!     c: &mut Circuit3,
//!     // AN NFT, whose `transferFrom` returns nothing …
//!     callee: Contract<erc721::Erc721>,
//!     from: Bytes<20, Private>,
//!     to: Bytes<20, Private>,
//!     amount: Uint<128, Private>,
//!     key_version: Uint<8>,
//!     nonce: Uint<64>,
//!     env: Amount,
//! ) {
//!     // ERROR: the trait bound `Erc721: Extends<Erc20>` is not satisfied
//!     BLOCK.pulls.request(
//!         c, callee, (from, to, amount), key_version, nonce, |_, _| env,
//!     );
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! and the other way round, where the flag would be discarded:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use minocrab::v3::Circuit3;

//! use minocrab_contracts::evm::{erc20, erc721, Kinded};

//! #[derive(Ledger)]
//! struct Block {
//!     signet: Signet,
//!     pulls: Pending<Kinded<erc721::TransferFrom, 1>, Amount, 3>,
//! }
//! const BLOCK: Block = Block::new();
//!
//! fn pull(
//!     c: &mut Circuit3,
//!     // A FUNGIBLE TOKEN, whose `transferFrom` returns a flag …
//!     callee: Contract<erc20::Erc20>,
//!     from: Bytes<20, Private>,
//!     to: Bytes<20, Private>,

//!     );
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! THE POSITIVE TWIN — the same two slots, each filed against the callee
//! whose interface it names, in one block:
//!
//! ```
//! use minocrab::v3::Circuit3;
//! use minocrab::{Private, Public};

//! }
//! const BLOCK: Block = Block::new();
//!

//! fn pull_both(

//!
//! # What is NOT here
//!
//! `safeTransferFrom` in both its overloads. The three-argument one is
//! static, but the four-argument one takes a `bytes data` — a DYNAMIC type,
//! which is rung E — and shipping only half of a pair whose whole point is
//! the receiver hook would be worse than shipping neither. `setApprovalForAll`
//! is here because it is the approval an operator contract actually needs,
//! and [`Approve`] because a single-token approval is the narrower grant.
