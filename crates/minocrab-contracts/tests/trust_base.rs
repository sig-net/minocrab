//! M33 — the trusted-computing-base inventory, generated not typed.
//!
//! `TRUST.md` at the repository root carries a table, one row per source
//! file of the seven eDSL crates: its lines, WHAT WARRANTS IT (which test,
//! proof or gate would catch a wrong line), and the failure that would hide
//! there if it were wrong. The rows whose warrant is READING are the trusted
//! computing base — the part a human reviewer has to read.
//!
//! The classification is DATA in this file ([`ROWS`]); the line counts are
//! measured; the table in `TRUST.md` is regenerated between its markers by
//! `MINOCRAB_TRUST_BASE=1 cargo test -p minocrab-contracts --test trust_base`
//! (the same reviewable-diff rule as the snapshots). The test fails when:
//! a classified file no longer exists, a source file of those crates is not
//! classified (closure, so a new file cannot slip in unwarranted), or the
//! table in `TRUST.md` is stale.
//!
//! THE ONE ERROR THE TABLE MUST NOT CONTAIN is a warrant claimed that is not
//! there: where unsure, a row says READING and a reviewer downgrades it,
//! never the reverse (milestones.org M33).
