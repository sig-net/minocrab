//! A SLOT OVER A CALL THAT RETURNS NOTHING — `Return = Unit`, and the
//! tickets that settle it (M38 rung B, notes/evm-interfaces.org §5).
//!
//! Two things this file is the witness for, neither of which could be
//! written before this rung:
//!
//! 1. A `Pending<Kinded<usdt::Transfer, K>, Env, 2>` — the NON-CONFORMING
//!    token's transfer, the one whose absent `bool` would otherwise be read
//!    as a flag (notes/evm-calls.org §3.1) — forms `Succeeded` and `Failed`
//!    tickets and settles with them. The attested value is `()`: zero
//!    argument slots, nothing to decode, nothing to be fooled by. `()`
//!    became a `CircuitArg` and a `CircuitBorsh` in minocrab-std for this
//!    (M37 finding iii, second part), and this is what needed it.
//! 2. WETH's payable `deposit()` — zero calldata words, the ether in the
//!    transaction's `value` field — files through `request_payable` and
//!    settles the same way. `Withdraw` is its non-payable twin, and the
//!    same `Contract<Weth>` cell takes an `erc20::Transfer` too, which is
//!    interface inheritance's first shipped use.
//!
//! IT IS A TEST-ONLY CONTRACT, like `tests/nested_typed.rs`'s: it exercises
//! the API without adding circuits to the crate's frozen snapshots
//! (`tests/support/mod.rs` lists what those cover). Nothing here is a
//! deployment.
