//! THE OTHER DIRECTION: a contract we BUILD, against the interface crate
//! it exports.
//!
//! `signet-signer-interface`'s own suite checks the crate against the
//! DEPLOYED artifact — a claim about somebody else's contract. This checks
//! it against `signet_contract`, the MinoCrab port of that same contract,
//! which is a promise: anyone who imports the crate and calls our
//! `signBidirectional` gets the layout the crate advertises.
//!
//! What is compared is the built `IrSource` — the very bytes that become
//! the deployed `.zkir` — against the trait's declared argument types, per
//! circuit: the declared input count, the opening constraint prefix slot
//! for slot (each constraint on the input of ITS slot), the communications
//! commitment, and the returned slot count. It is the same comparison
//! `minocrab-abi` runs against a corpus artifact, pointed at ourselves.
//!
//! It is at its most valuable for `respond` and `respondBidirectional`,
//! whose parameter list is the event's fields ONE LEVEL FLATTER than the
//! interface's `{ signature: { … } }` (see `respond_like`'s note): the
//! leaves are the crate's own `AffinePoint`/`RequestId`, but the nesting is
//! not, so nothing at the type level says the flattening is faithful. This
//! test is what says it.
