//! M38 rung D — THE FIXTURE ORACLE: every EVM call's selector and every ABI
//! word pinned against **alloy's** encoder, not against our own.
//!
//! `tests/evm_abi.rs` checks our selectors against the vault's constants
//! (which `erc20_vault_differential` pins against compactc's own calldata)
//! and our words against the host-side model in `tests/vault/prims.rs`.
//! Both of those are OURS. This file adds the outside witness: each call is
//! declared a SECOND time, in Solidity, through `alloy_sol_types::sol!`, and
//! the assertions are
//!
//! 1. `Call::signature() == solCall::SIGNATURE`,
//! 2. `Call::selector() == solCall::SELECTOR`, and
//! 3. for GENERATED argument values, the words our `AbiType::word` encoders
//!    produce as circuit wires — run through the simulator and read back as
//!    bytes — equal `solCall { .. }.abi_encode()[4..]` split into 32-byte
//!    words.
//!
//! The dependency is pinned EXACTLY at `alloy-sol-types`/`alloy-primitives`
//! 1.6.1, the versions sig-net/mpc's own `Cargo.lock` resolves (the four
//! macro crates behind them are pinned to 1.6.1 in our lock too), so the
//! oracle is the encoder the MPC itself runs rather than "some ABI library".
//!
//! `tests/evm_abi.rs`'s compactc-calldata pins stay exactly as they are:
//! they are the INDEPENDENT control, and alloy does not replace them.
//!
//! # Adding a row
//!
//! Adding a call to this oracle needs three things and touches no harness
//! code:
//!
//! 1. A `sol!` declaration of the function as ETHEREUM spells it, in the
//!    interface's `sol_*` module below. `uint256` wherever our word type is
//!    `U64`/`U128`/`U256` — those are OUR range bounds on a 32-byte word,
//!    not different Solidity types. A struct argument is a `struct` item
//!    plus a function taking it (see [`sol_uniswap_v3`]).
//! 2. A [`SampleLeaf`] impl for any `AbiType` the call uses that has none
//!    yet — the host-side value, its proptest strategy, the field limbs it
//!    enters the circuit as, and how to rebuild the wire from them. All TEN
//!    of today's leaves already have one (`U8` joined at M38 rung B, for
//!    ERC-2612 `permit`'s `v`; `U16` at rung C, for Aave v3's
//!    `referralCode`).
//! 3. One row in the [`oracle_rows!`] invocation:
//!
//!    ```text
//!    /// doc comment
//!    name: our::CallType => sol_mod::fnNameCall,
//!    |(a, b, ..)| sol_mod::fnNameCall { a: …, b: … };
//!    ```
//!
//!    The pattern destructures the generated `Values` tuple (one entry per
//!    argument, in order, of that leaf's [`SampleLeaf::Value`] type); the
//!    expression builds the alloy call struct from them. The macro emits a
//!    `mod name` with a `signature_and_selector` test and a proptest `words`
//!    test.
//!
//! # What is not pinned here
//!
//! The RETURN types. `EvmCall::Return` is what the MPC attests and narrows
//! (`AbiType::RESPOND`), and the narrowing is a Signet protocol fact, not an
//! ABI one — alloy has nothing to say about it. `tests/evm_abi.rs` and
//! `src/evm.rs`'s unit tests keep those.
