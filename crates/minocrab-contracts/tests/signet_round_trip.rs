//! M35 rung D, THE STATE-DRIVING HALF: request → post → respond, chained on
//! a real `StateValue` through the Impact VM under plain `cargo test`.
//!
//! Rung D built the responder (`crates/signet-sim`) but could not chain it,
//! because nothing produced a circuit's transcript from ledger state. The
//! executor (`minocrab_sim::v3::exec`) does, so this file closes the loop as
//! far as it goes:
//!
//! 1. a request circuit runs against a real pre-state; the executor derives
//!    its transcript FROM that state and the Impact VM applies it;
//! 2. the singleton's notification is built from the slot's OWN declared
//!    path (`Pending::record_path`, the one the artifact-agreement gate pins
//!    against the compiled contract-info);
//! 3. `SigNetSim` — the MPC's own reader, translated — walks the POST state
//!    by that path, finds the record the circuit filed, recomputes its id
//!    from the bytes it decoded, and signs. Nothing is handed to it: every
//!    byte it reads was written by the circuit into a `StateValue`.
//!
//! It also chains the pairs THROUGH state: a request circuit's post-state is
//! the state its settle circuit reads, with nothing carried between them but
//! a `StateValue`. That is what M35 D's `cargo test` speed asks for, and it
//! is the first time a settle in this workspace has read a record it was not
//! handed.
//!
//! The adversarial responders live here too, each hitting the reader's own
//! drop reason by name.
//!
//! The last link, `respond → settle`, closed on 2026-09-07 (decisions.org
//! T1): the typed settle's digest now packs the output the way the MPC's
//! `compute_response_hash` does — `the_typed_settle_digest_is_the_digest_the_
//! mpc_signs` pins the agreement, and the chained pairs below settle against
//! the sim's own attestation. See notes/signet-async.org §10.
