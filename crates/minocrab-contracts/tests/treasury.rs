//! `treasury` — the README's cross-chain example, run (M37 rung C).
//!
//! The contract is notes/evm-calls.org §0's target shape as real code; this
//! file is the evidence that it is not just a shape. Every case below builds
//! a `ProofPreimage` BY HAND — the ledger op stream, the argument slots, the
//! witnesses, and a real secp256k1 signature over a real Poseidon
//! attestation digest — and hands it to the simulator, the way
//! `tests/vault_pending` does for the vault's seventeen circuits.
//!
//! What the round trips pin (notes/evm-calls.org §3, the SYMMETRIC tickets):
//!
//! | attestation                  | `complete` | `refund`, owner | `refund`, stranger |
//! |------------------------------|-----------:|----------------:|-------------------:|
//! | this kind, flag `true`       |     ACCEPT |          reject |             reject |
//! | this kind, flag `false`      |     reject |          ACCEPT |             reject |
//! | the MPC's failure kind       |     reject |          ACCEPT |             reject |
//!
//! The middle row is the one the deployed vault gets wrong: its
//! `completeWithdraw` accepts an attested `false` and refunds inside the
//! completion, so a transfer that moved nothing can be marked done. Here a
//! `false` cannot complete, whoever presents it, because
//! `Erc20Transfer::Outcome = ByFlag` and `complete` asserts the rule.
//!
//! The third column is `Owned`: the environment carries a commitment to the
//! SENDER's secret, and `refund_to_owner` opens it against a fresh witness.
