//! The vault on `Pending` (M35 rung C): layout, and row cost against the
//! modern lineage circuit by circuit.
//!
//! The cost rule of the milestone: the `Pending` calls do what the modern
//! circuits did by hand, so a circuit costing MORE here is a bug in the API,
//! not a price of it. Where a circuit here does strictly less work (no
//! calldata re-parse, no second map for the refund marker) it may cost
//! less, and the table below records the measured pair for the note.
//!
//! The modern lineage was RETIRED in M28 (notes/vault-refresh.org §0); its
//! side of the comparison is the `(k, rows)` the row snapshot last froze for
//! it (commit abb4cfb, 2026-09-05), kept here as the baseline the rule was
//! stated against.
