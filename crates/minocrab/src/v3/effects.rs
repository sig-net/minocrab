//! THE EFFECT CHOKE POINT: the one place the ambient guard is read, and the
//! only route to the raw emitters whose meaning depends on it.
//!
//! A ZKIR circuit has no control flow. `c.when(g, |c| body)` runs the body
//! unconditionally and relies on every EFFECT emitted inside it — a witness
//! read, a public-transcript read, an Impact op, a check — consulting the
//! guard stack. Before this module that consultation was made method by
//! method: `witness` did, `witness_guarded` did not; `assert` did,
//! `assert_eq` / `assert_bits` / `assert_boolean` did not;
//! `public_transcript_input_guarded` was fixed to, one commit after the AA
//! manager port found it. Each was a cell in a table nothing checked, and
//! each miss is invisible to a differential on an honest preimage — the
//! guard only matters on the path that was not taken.
//!
//! Now there is one table entry. [`EffectGuard`] is the resolved guard; its
//! field is private to this module, so the only way to obtain one is
//! [`Circuit3::effect_guard`], which is the only reader of the ambient
//! stack. Every `emit_*` below demands one. The parent module therefore has
//! no spelling of "emit an effect under a guard that skipped the scope": a
//! public entry point either resolves through `effect_guard` or it cannot
//! call an emitter at all. A test at the bottom pins the other half — that
//! the parent reaches none of the raw builder emitters directly.
//!
//! Semantics per effect, all compactc's own lowering for `if`:
//!
//! - READS (`private_input`, `public_input`) carry the guard as the
//!   instruction's own operand: false ⇒ the type's default, transcript not
//!   consumed.
//! - IMPACT carries it as its guard operand.
//! - CHECKS have no guard operand in ZKIR, so the guard selects the value
//!   checked: `assert(x)` becomes `assert(select(g, x, 1))`;
//!   `constrain_bits(w, k)` becomes `constrain_bits(select(g, w, 0), k)`,
//!   likewise `constrain_to_boolean`; `constrain_eq(a, b)` — which has no
//!   value to select — becomes `test_eq` + a guarded `assert`, the shape
//!   compactc emits for `assert(a == b)` inside a branch. Straight-line
//!   circuits (no ambient guard) emit exactly what they did before: the
//!   direct instruction, no select.
