//! Typed disclosure declarations: what a circuit is allowed to make public,
//! stated in its signature and checked by a generated test.
//!
//! [`Circuit3::disclose`](super::Circuit3::disclose) is the audit point —
//! every value leaving the private domain passes through it and names itself
//! — but the name is a free string at one call site, and nothing says what
//! the circuit as a whole reveals. This layer adds the missing half
//! (notes/contract-api.org §Disclosure declaration):
//!
//! ```ignore
//! label!(RequestId = "request id");
//! label!(RequestRecord = "request record");
//!
//! #[circuit]
//! pub fn deposit(c: &mut Circuit3, ..) -> Discloses<(DepositorCommitment, RequestId, RequestRecord)> {
//!     ..
//!     let request_id = request_id.disclose_as::<RequestId>(c);
//!     ..
//!     Discloses::of(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The enforcement is split, deliberately:
//!
//! - rustc checks the SYMBOLS. A label is a type, so a typo or a rename is a
//!   compile error at both the declaration and the call site, and the two
//!   share one definition.
//! - a GENERATED TEST checks the SET. `#[circuit]` emits a `#[test]` that
//!   builds the circuit and compares the declared labels against the ones it
//!   actually disclosed, failing with the fix spelled out
//!   ([`assert_declared_disclosures`]). Full static enforcement would need a
//!   label set threaded through `&mut Circuit3` as type state — rejected as
//!   baroque; a plain test failure that names the label and the edit is
//!   worth more than a type error nobody can read.
//!
//! A circuit FAMILY parameterized by a Rust value has no attribute to
//! generate that test from — `#[circuit]` makes a nullary constructor, so
//! such a family is built through `entry()` by hand. It declares exactly the
//! same way (the closure's return type is the declaration; `entry` takes any
//! zero-slot [`CircuitOut`](../../../minocrab_std/v3/trait.CircuitOut.html)),
//! and its test is the expansion's own body written out once per
//! instantiation:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! type DepositDisclosures = Discloses<(Amount, Recipient)>;
//!
//! fn base_with_emits(emits: usize) -> Compiled3 {
//!     entry(|c, args: DepositArgs| -> DepositDisclosures { ..; Discloses::of(()) })
//! }
//!
//! #[test]
//! fn the_declared_disclosures_are_the_ones_the_family_makes() {
//!     for emits in [0, 1, 2, 4] {
//!         assert_declared_disclosures::<DepositDisclosures>(
//!             &format!("base_with_emits({emits})"), &base_with_emits(emits));
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The alias is what makes the entry point and the test the SAME declaration
//! — the attribute gets that for free by copying the return type's tokens.
//! (An alias is deliberately NOT accepted in a `#[circuit]` signature, where
//! the declaration has to be legible where the arguments are.)
//!
//! Labels are per LOGICAL VALUE, not per wire: `b32.disclose_as::<L>(c)`
//! discloses both limbs under the single symbol `L`, where the hand-written
//! circuits wrote `"… (hi)"` and `"… (lo)"`. One record, one label, one
//! entry in the declaration (see [`Disclosure3`](super::Disclosure3)).
//!
//! [`Discloses<D, R>`](Discloses) is a real zero-sized wrapper around the
//! circuit's return value, not a macro rewrite of the signature: `D` is the
//! declaration, `R` the value (`()` for Compact's `[]` circuits, which is
//! why it is the default). Being a real type, it costs nothing — its
//! `CircuitOut` impl (in minocrab-std, where that trait lives) is `R`'s —
//! and rust-analyzer sees a normal generic type rather than something a
//! macro invented.
//!
//! Placement: here rather than in minocrab-std, because a disclosure is a
//! frontend concept and every crate that discloses needs the vocabulary —
//! `minocrab_ledger::contract_call` discloses a cross-contract call's
//! entry-point hash and commitment, and those labels have to be nameable in
//! the CALLER's declaration. minocrab-std adds the [`Disclose`] impls for
//! its own value types.
