//! L2 — the MinoCrab eDSL.
//!
//! Circuits are ordinary Rust built against [`v3::Circuit3`]; wires carry
//! their visibility in the type. A `Wire3<_, Private>` cannot reach a
//! public output — there is no method for it — until it passes through
//! [`v3::Circuit3::disclose`] (or `disclose_as::<Label>`), which is the
//! single, greppable gate for information leaving the private domain.
//! Combining wires taints: any operation touching a private wire yields a
//! private wire (see [`Meet`]).
//!
//! Disclosure policy escape hatch: `disclose` *is* the override — it always
//! compiles, and every call site names what it discloses, so `grep disclose`
//! is the audit. Stricter application policies wrap wires in newtypes that
//! hide `disclose` behind their own rules (e.g. range-blind first).
//!
//! The enforcement is a type error, not a runtime check:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use minocrab::v3::{Circuit3, FieldT};
//! let mut c = Circuit3::new();
//! let secret = c.witness::<FieldT>();
//! // ERROR: expected `Wire3<FieldT, Public>`, found `Wire3<FieldT, Private>`
//! c.output(secret, "leak");
//! ```
//!
//! With `disclose` it compiles — and the leak is named and greppable:
//!
//! ```
//! use minocrab::v3::{Circuit3, FieldT};
//! let mut c = Circuit3::new();
//! let secret = c.witness::<FieldT>();
//! let public = c.disclose(secret, "intentionally published");
//! c.output(public, "value");
//! ```
//!
//! # Where this sits
//!
//! The middle of the MinoCrab stack: it builds on [`minocrab_ir`] (L1, the
//! typed instruction builder) and is what `minocrab-std` (L3, the ports of
//! Compact's standard library), `minocrab-ledger` (L2.5, Impact ledger ops)
//! and `minocrab-macros` (`#[circuit]`, `#[contract]`) are all written
//! against. `minocrab-sim` runs what [`v3::Circuit3::finish`] produces
//! under `cargo test`. Every contract targets ZKIR v3; there is no other
//! frontend.
//!
//! # Start here
//!
//! - [`v3::Circuit3`] — the builder; [`v3::Wire3`] — a typed, visibility-
//!   tagged value
//! - [`Visibility`] ([`Public`] / [`Private`]) and [`Meet`] — the lattice
//!   wires combine under
//! - [`v3::Circuit3::disclose`] / [`v3::DisclosureLabel`] — the single
//!   Private→Public gate, and the thing to grep for
//! - [`v3::Discloses`] and [`v3::assert_declared_disclosures`] — a circuit
//!   declares what it discloses, and a generated test checks it
//! - [`v3::Compiled3`] — a finished circuit: the IR plus its disclosure
//!   record and regions
//!
//! # Stability (M24 tier boundary)
//!
//! STABLE TIER (semver commitment): the v3 eDSL authoring core —
//! [`v3::Circuit3`] and its instruction-emitting methods, [`v3::Wire3`] /
//! [`v3::AnyWire3`], the visibility types, the FAB alignment re-exports,
//! and [`v3::Compiled3`]. The proposed stable set is deliberately small
//! (notes/library-api.org §1) and grows only by decision, never by
//! accident.
