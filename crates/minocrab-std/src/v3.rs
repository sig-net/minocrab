///
/// ```text
/// AlignmentAtom::Compress => transient_commit(bytes, len)   // 0 if bytes is empty
/// ```
///
/// Three consequences, and they are the whole API:

///   commitments, so it decides equality of the TS-side values up to Poseidon
///   collision resistance. It is not pointer identity.

///   string is special-cased upstream — which is why compactc lowers
///   `default<Opaque<"string">>` to the immediate `0x00` with no ceremony.

///   (`AlignmentAtom::parse_field_repr` returns `None` for `Compress`), so
///   there is no byte view, no length, no way to build one in circuit, and no
///   hash: [`hash::persistent_hash`] is bounded on
///   [`CircuitBorsh`](borsh::CircuitBorsh), which this type deliberately does
///   not implement (§5 of notes/opaque-bridging.org). compactc refuses the same
///   thing in almost the same words — *"persistentHash cannot be applied to a
///   first argument containing opaque JavaScript values"*.
///
/// # Where it can appear
///
/// Everywhere a Compact `Opaque` can: circuit argument, circuit result,
/// witness result, ledger `Cell` / `Map` key / `Map` value / `Set` element,
/// struct field, and either side of a cross-contract call. The fixture
/// `tests/fixtures/opaque/opaque.compact` in `minocrab-contracts` has one
/// circuit per position.
///
/// # The ts-type is part of the type
///
/// Two opaques of different TS types have the same LAYOUT — one `compress`
/// atom each — so nothing in the ABI keeps them apart. The Rust type parameter
/// does, and it is a compile error rather than a lint:
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// use minocrab::v3::Circuit3;
