//! The ledger block as TYPES: `#[derive(Ledger)]`, [`LedgerMap`],
//! [`LedgerCell`], [`LedgerCounter`].
//!
//! Below this module, `minocrab_ledger` emits compactc's vm-code for one
//! ledger operation at a time and takes two things a caller has to get right
//! by hand: the FIELD INDEX (a `u8`) and the value's FAB ATOMS (a
//! `Vec<AlignmentAtom>` written out at the call site). Both are silent
//! hazards — an index off by one reads another field, an atom list that does
//! not match the stored value's changes the PI stream — and neither is
//! visible to a type checker.
//!
//! This module removes both, and nothing else:
//!
//! - the index comes from the DECLARATION ORDER of a `#[derive(Ledger)]`
//!   struct that mirrors the Compact `export ledger` block, so the mapping
//!   lives once, where the fields are declared;
//! - the atoms come from the key/value TYPE through [`LedgerRepr`], so
//!   `Map<RequestId, Bytes<32>>` is `LedgerMap<B32<Public>, B32<Public>>` and
//!   nobody writes `vec![AlignmentAtom::Bytes { length: 32 }]` again.
//!
//! THE INVARIANT (notes/contract-api.org §The design): no method here issues
//! more Impact ops than the one Compact operation it names. Every method is a
//! one-line call into `minocrab_ledger`, and `c` and the guard stay VISIBLE
//! in the signature — a ledger operation is a cost, and the call site says so.
//! `map[k]` sugar, `Deref`, `entry()` and iterators are REJECTED for the same
//! reason.
//!
//! NESTING (M22 stage B2) keeps that invariant exactly. `at_key` is the one
//! method that emits NOTHING — it builds compactc's path `f`, which is what
//! an intermediate `Map.lookup` is at compile time — and the leaf method
//! still emits the ONE operation it names, with the path re-encoded into it.
//! A slot is therefore a PATH rather than a field index: see [`FieldPath`]
//! (const, from the declaration, and more than one element as soon as a block
//! declares sixteen fields) and [`KeyPath`] (runtime, one element per
//! `at_key`).

// written against it. It has TWO halves, and they differ in when they are
// known:
//
//   - the FIELD path, const, from the declaration. Usually one element — the
//     field index — but `determine-ledger-paths.ss` BATCHES a block's fields
//     into segments of fifteen (`maximum-ledger-segment-length`, langs.ss:851),
//     so a sixteen-field block gives every field a TWO-element path and
//     `#[derive(Ledger)]` hands each slot the path rather than an index;
//   - the KEYS, runtime, one per `at_key` — a map key is generally a circuit
//     wire, so a nested handle is a VALUE holding cloned limbs where a
//     declared handle is a `const`.
//
// Hence two path types and one sealed trait over them. Keeping them apart is
// not tidiness: a declared handle must stay DROP-FREE or
// `const I: u8 = VAULT.field.index();` stops compiling (E0493), and a nested
// handle must own a `Vec` because that is what a key is.

/// The most elements a FIELD path can have: `batch`'s tree is one level deep
