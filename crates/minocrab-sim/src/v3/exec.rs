//! The v3 transcript EXECUTOR: a circuit's public transcript produced from
//! LEDGER STATE rather than from a hand model.
//!
//! [`simulate`](super::simulate) verifies a complete [`ProofPreimage`]: the
//! values a ledger read witnesses come from `public_transcript_outputs`,
//! which something else had to supply. Until this module existed the only
//! supplier in the workspace was a hand-written reference model (the vault
//! harness's 3.8k lines), so nothing could chain one call's post-state into
//! the next call's reads. This module closes that: given a circuit, its
//! arguments and its private transcript, it runs the circuit against a live
//! [`StateValue`] and returns the transcript the prover would have built —
//! the Impact op stream, both public halves, and the post-state.
//!
//! # What is Midnight's and what is ours
//!
//! REUSED, unchanged:
//! - [`ResultModeGather`] and [`GatherEvent`] (onchain-vm `result_mode.rs`) —
//!   Midnight's own "run this program and tell me what the state actually
//!   holds" mode. Its `process_read` takes `()` as the expected value and
//!   records the real one.
//! - [`run_program`] (onchain-vm `vm.rs`) and `QueryContext::query`
//!   (onchain-runtime `context.rs`) — the Impact VM itself, generic in the
//!   result mode. Nothing here interprets an `Op`.
//! - `Op::translate` (onchain-vm `ops.rs:405`) — Midnight's own gather →
//!   verify join, which fills a `Popeq`'s `()` with the gathered value. The
//!   upstream idiom that pairs it with a value stream is
//!   `zswap::verify::with_outputs`; that one is behind a cargo feature and
//!   filters the program first, so [`Executed::ops`] does the same zip here.
//! - [`super::simulate_with`] — the ZKIR instruction walk, the same one
//!   [`simulate`](super::simulate) runs, in [`Mode::Gather`].
//!
//! WRITTEN HERE, because nothing upstream has it (surveyed 2026-09-06 over
//! midnight-ledger `04c9c5d9`; notes/executor.org §2 records the search):
//! - [`decode_program`] — the INVERSE of `Op::field_repr`. Upstream encodes
//!   an op stream into field elements (that is what a circuit's
//!   `public_transcript_inputs` IS) but never decodes one, because in
//!   production the ops travel beside the proof rather than inside it. A
//!   ZKIR circuit, though, only carries the elements, so recovering the ops
//!   is the one thing that had to be written. It is the exact inverse of
//!   `minocrab-ledger`'s encoder, and `minocrab-ledger`'s own test suite
//!   round-trips every op shape that crate emits through it.
//! - [`execute`] — the fixpoint driver below.
//!
//! # Why a fixpoint
//!
//! A ledger read compiles to `public_input` gates FIRST and the op stream
//! that justifies them second (the gates are embedded in the closing
//! `popeq`), and a read's value can decide whether a later block is emitted
//! at all (an `Impact` under a guard the read produced). So there is no
//! single forward pass: the transcript the circuit asks for depends on the
//! answers, and the answers depend on the transcript.
//!
//! The loop is therefore the obvious one, and it is a fixpoint on the
//! `public_transcript_outputs` vector:
//!
//! 1. run the ZKIR walk against the guess (starting empty — a read past the
//!    end of the guess reads zeros);
//! 2. decode the accumulated `Impact` inputs into an op program;
//! 3. run that program against the live state in `ResultModeGather`;
//! 4. the gathered read values ARE the next guess.
//!
//! Each round fixes at least the first read the previous guess got wrong
//! (op emission depends only on EARLIER reads, so every op before the first
//! wrong answer is already right), which is why step 3 falls back to the
//! longest prefix that runs when the whole program does not: the reads it
//! yields are still correct, and the next round gets further. That bounds
//! the loop by the number of reads, and [`MAX_ROUNDS`] enforces it.
